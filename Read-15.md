But those who are filled with feelings of dread and panic in such a situation—or anywhere the person might be center of attention—may be suffering from a form of social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia).

The fear of public speaking or performance, often called stage fright, exacts a huge toll on self-confidence and self-esteem and causes some people to leave school or a job or pass up a promotion. Many, including seasoned professional performers, suffer in silent terror. And because they feel embarrassed, people try to keep their fear a secret, even from a spouse or other close family members or friends.
