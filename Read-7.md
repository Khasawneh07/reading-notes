Chapter 6: Tables

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,<tbody>, and <tfoot>.
