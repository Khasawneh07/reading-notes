- Browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox.. etc).
- Web service (a special computers that's connected to internet and access to the browsers for requests any website).
- Screen Readers (programs that read to the user the content of the screen).
- Devices (such as Computer, Mobile, Laptop.. etc).

Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

Chapter 18: Process & Design.

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplifyd the information you present.

Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming:

- Computers create models of the world using data.
- The models use objects to represent physical things. Objects can have properties that tell us about the object methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object: events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.
- programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs, run that code."  
- Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object).
- To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
