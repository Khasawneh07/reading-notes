Chapter 3:Object Literals


Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names.

- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts



Chapter 5: Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies 
how browsers should create a model of an HTML 
page and how JavaScript can access and update the 
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. 
- DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, 
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
- You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass 
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one 
node, it will always return a Nadel i st. 
- From an element node, you can access and update its 
content using properties such as textContent and 
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and 
child elements that are siblings of each other. 
- In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is 
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
- Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
