Chapter 4: Links

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. 

- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

Chapter 15: Layout

This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be 
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this 
chapter we will:

- Explore different ways to position elements using normal 
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
- Discover how various devices have different screen sizes 
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
- Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, 
and how they are created.
- Find out how designers use grids to make their page 
designs look more professional.
- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

Chapter 3 : Functions, Methods, and Objects

Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. 
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce: 
- FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS 
- BUILT-IN 
- METHODS OBJECTS

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

pair programming work

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.
