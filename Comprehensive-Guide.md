# Comprehensive Guide



Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).

In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.

**Version Control**

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. 
Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals,and compare changes. 
By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

**Local Version Control**

Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

**Centralized Version Control**

The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). 
This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. 
This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases).

**Distributed Version Control**

A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. 
If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. 
Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines.
