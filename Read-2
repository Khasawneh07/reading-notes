Chapter 2: Text

Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver 
usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a 
code view.

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of 
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that 
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should 
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one 
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.
