Chapter 2: Text

Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver 
usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a 
code view.

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that 
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should 
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one 
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
Statements should end with a semicolon.

- A script is made up of a series of statements . 
- Each statement is like a step in a recipe . 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions . 
- For example , you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value . 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script . 
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information JavaScript distinguishes between numbers ( 0-9 ) , strings ( text ) , and Boolean values ( true or false ) . 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value . 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value BASIC JAVASCRIPT. 

Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. 
To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts. 

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
- if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
