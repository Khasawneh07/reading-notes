Chapter 7: Forms

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.
Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or you need to create more complicated insurance applications,HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from your users. In this chapter you will learn:
- How to create a form on your website
- The different tools for collecting data
- New HTML5 form controls

- Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a<form> element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.



Chapter 14: Lists, Tables & Forms

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,and forms.
In this chapter you will learn how to:
- Specify the type of bullet point or numbering on lists
- Add borders and backgrounds to table cells
- Control the appearance of form controls Together, these properties allow you to take finer control over specific parts of your pages.


- roperties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements,there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.


Chapter 6: Events

When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.
Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive.

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
