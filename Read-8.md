Ch.15 : Layout

- Controlling t XX he position of elements.
- Creating site layouts.
- Designing for different sized screens.

In this chapter we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.
This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:

- Explore different ways to position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
- Discover how various devices have different screen sizes and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
- Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,and how they are created.
- Find out how designers use grids to make their page designs look more professional.

Summary:

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
