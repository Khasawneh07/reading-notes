Chapter 3: Lists

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
- Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
  For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order,or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.


Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

A switch statement starts with avariable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
