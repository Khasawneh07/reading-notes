Chapter 3: Lists

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
- Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
  For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order,or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
